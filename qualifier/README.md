# Project Title
# BizOps Dynamic Loan Selection Program
Just after the title, introduce your project by describing attractively what the project is about and what is the main problem that inspires you to create this project or what is the main contribution for the potential user of your project.
The BizOps Dynamic Loan Selection Program (internally referred to as BDLSP) builds on the original loan qualification assesment program developed by Mayan Engineering & Consulting LLC (MEC) for the BizOps team. The original program as a first step, performed the basic functions of proofing a client loan application, reviewing and recording the individual parameters of the application and matching it to the bank's internal criteria for loan selection an approval. The inital platform was a success in terms of establishing a basic foundation for loan evaluation and supporting decision making to approve loans. However the process still called for a systematic input of loan data by an IT professional in order to maintain the integrity of the code structure.  While this was recognized as a acceptable feature based on the user stories, it was also stated as a requirement that the loan program users should be run by loan officers within the bank while IT professionals were only to be used to maintain the system program.  Also, the user story for the second phase required making the loan program more dynamic to the user while not skipping any critical steps in the evaluation process. In this regard BDLSP has upgraded the loan qualifier program

## Technologies

Describe the technologies required to use your project such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the specific versions of any critical dependencies that you have used in the stable version of your project.
The programming languages utilized to write the code were Python version 3.8, vscode, GitBash. The primary version of the code was written on vscode with the use of some python libraries. The libraries utilized were Python Fire to generate & create CLI'sand help in debugging the Python code. The second important library used was Python Questionary to use a variety of arguments in making the program more flexible. GitBash was used to run the code & verify its outputs were consistent with the actions, goals and requirements recorded from the user stories.

## Installation Guide

In this section, you should include detailed installation notes containing code blocks and screenshots.
The code was constructed using a modular approach to faciltate efficiencies in troubleshootin or for  future upgrades. 

The basic file structure was set up using a  modular structure of the code for running all the calculations & filters under the qualifier folder. The data folder willcontain the .csv files generateda s afinal output.

The BDLSP was a collaborative process with President of MEC (Mr. Vesh Subramanian) interfacing Python coding experts (Mr. Pablo Jordan and Mr. Eric Cadena and their supporting staff from Rice University. MEC engineers wrote the code under the guidance & supervision of the Rice University coding experts.
